  publish (Pandoc, Publish), versioning (Git), and plugin development (API).

guardrails:
  - plugin_security: >
      Community plugins run third-party code with access to your files. Enable
      only what you trust. Prefer official or core features; review plugin docs
      and code. Use Restricted Mode when unsure.
  - privacy_minimization: >
      Avoid storing secrets or personal data in plain text notes or templates.
      Prefer local or offline workflows and selective publishing. Evaluate each
      plugin or service Terms of Service for data handling.
  - mobile_variance: >
      Many plugins work on mobile but not all. Verify per-plugin mobile support
      before relying on them.
  - licensing_note: >
      Obsidian core is user-supported software with optional paid add-ons.
      Community plugins are typically open source. Check each plugin license and
      repository.
